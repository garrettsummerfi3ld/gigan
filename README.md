## How to use

Download the repository and prep for deployment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrettsummerfi3ld/gigan.git

# On macOS/Linux
chmod +x ./gradlew

# To build and load dependencies
./gradlew build
```

Ensure you are connected to a roboRIO via Wi-Fi or USB direct connect.

> [!TIP]
>
> It is recommended to open up Visual Studio Code with WPILib or [WPILib's distribution of VS Code](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) for easier access to diagnostic tools and console logs, as well as GradleRIO being default included.

Deploy the software to the roboRIO.

```bash
./gradlew deploy
```

_If you are using the WPILib extension:_

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) / `Command(âŒ˜)+Shift+P` (macOS)
- WPILib: Deploy Robot Code

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also access commonly used WPILib commands when clicking on the WPILib icon on an open file, this only shows up if you have WPILib VS Code opened
